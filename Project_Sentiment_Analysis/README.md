# Sentiment analysis on IMDB data using Amazon Web Services.

In this project I performed sentiment analysis on the IMDB data set (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

This repository contains some of the files (Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks) that have been used for the development and deployment of a sentiment analysis model
in Amazon SageMaker and requiring the use of other AWS services such as AWS S3, AWS Lambda and AWS Api gateway for the creation and the deployment of an HTTP endpoint that can send
and receive predictions from the passed-in data.
